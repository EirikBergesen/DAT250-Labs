#### Installing MongoDB
Problem:
I forgot to take pictures while I encountered this problem, but i found some pictures from someone having the same problem as i did.

I got an error message when trying to do the installer. I did not understand why the installer would not accept the username and

and password for what i assumed was for the local database.
