## DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2





I get an error while trying to vertify the program in point 4.3:

I do not understand what is going on. I'll wait for the group session and try to get help there.
Seems like that was supposed to happen and that maven is wierd?


I had problems adding lombok correctly to my dependencies. Got help from a friend whom told me to click a "maven refresh"(?) button that pups up. I dont know what this is but it worked.

I met problems running lombok after having deleted the boilerplate code. Seemed like i had to manually update the dependency.

In point 6, where I am to create a new project and add the eclipselink files and the derby file, there is no .jar file in the downloaded folder:
