## DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2





I get an error while trying to vertify the program in point 4.3:
![Error in eclipse dat250 lab2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46929671/132375133-c7fad33a-8c73-429d-ac3c-e14240ca00b8.png)

I do not understand what is going on. I'll wait for the group session and try to get help there.
Seems like that was supposed to happen and that maven is wierd?


I had problems adding lombok correctly to my dependencies. Got help from a friend whom told me to click a "maven refresh"(?) button that pups up. I dont know what this is but it worked.

I met problems running lombok after having deleted the boilerplate code. Seemed like i had to manually update the dependency.

In point 6, where I am to create a new project and add the eclipselink files and the derby file, there is no javax.persistence_*.jar file in the downloaded folder:

Looked at the filestructure from the earlier project and found some of the .jar files that might hold the files that i needed. I then had problems getting intellij to recognise them as libraries.
