Problems with running HelloWorld application in Intellij after installation.
Intellij would not give me the run application option, and the run-configuration would not allow me to select my HelloWorld-class as the main class to run.
So i restarted the Intellij. I rewrote the code. And like magic, I was allowed to run the application.



Creating account Heroku.
After creating my account and validating my email, Heroku tells me that my account credidentials are invalid.
I closed the browser and went to the official Heroku site again, end then it worked.
